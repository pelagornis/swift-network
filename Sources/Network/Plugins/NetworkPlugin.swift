/**
 * A protocol for creating plugins that can intercept and modify network requests and responses.
 * 
 * Plugins allow you to add cross-cutting concerns to your network requests without modifying
 * the core networking code. They can be used for logging, authentication, caching, metrics,
 * and other functionality that needs to be applied to multiple requests.
 * 
 * ## Usage
 * ```swift
 * struct LoggingPlugin: NetworkPlugin {
 *     func willSend(_ request: URLRequest, target: Endpoint) {
 *         print("Sending request to: \(request.url?.absoluteString ?? "")")
 *     }
 *     
 *     func didReceive(_ result: Result<(Data, URLResponse), Error>, target: Endpoint) {
 *         switch result {
 *         case .success(let (data, response)):
 *             print("Received response: \(response)")
 *         case .failure(let error):
 *             print("Request failed: \(error)")
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
